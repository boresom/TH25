| Thanks, boresom. Let's cover a couple of
| quick housekeeping items before we begin our
| first lesson. First of all, you should know
| that when you see '...', that means you
| should press Enter when you are done reading
| and ready to continue.

...  <-- That's your cue to press Enter to continue

| Also, when you see 'ANSWER:', the R prompt
| (>), or when you are asked to select from a
| list, that means it's your turn to enter a
| response, then press Enter to continue.

Select 1, 2, or 3 and press Enter 

1: Continue.
2: Proceed.
3: Let's get going!

| You can exit swirl and return to the R
| prompt (>) at any time by pressing the Esc
| key. If you are already at the prompt, type
| bye() to exit and save your progress. When
| you exit properly, you'll see a short
| message letting you know you've done so.

| When you are at the R prompt (>):
| -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the
| current question.
| -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R
| on your own; swirl will ignore what you
| do...
| -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain
| swirl's attention.
| -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your
| progress will be saved.
| -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main
| menu.
| -- Typing info() displays these options
| again.

| Let's get started!

| In this lesson, we will explore some basic building
| blocks of the R programming language.

...

  |=                                              |   3%
| If at any point you'd like more information on a
| particular topic related to R, you can type
| help.start() at the prompt, which will open a menu of
| resources (either within RStudio or your default web
| browser, depending on your setup). Alternatively, a
| simple web search often yields the answer you're
| looking for.

...

  |==                                             |   5%
| In its simplest form, R can be used as an interactive
| calculator. Type 5 + 7 and press Enter.

> 5 + 7
[1] 12

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |====                                           |   8%
| R simply prints the result of 12 by default. However, R is a programming language and often
| the reason we use a programming language as opposed to a calculator is to automate some
| process or avoid unnecessary repetition.

...

  |=====                                          |  11%
| In this case, we may want to use our result from above in a second calculation. Instead of
| retyping 5 + 7 every time we need it, we can just create a new variable that stores the
| result.

...

  |======                                         |  13%
| The way you assign a value to a variable in R is by using the assignment operator, which is
| just a 'less than' symbol followed by a 'minus' sign. It looks like this: <-

...

  |=======                                        |  16%
| Think of the assignment operator as an arrow. You are assigning the value on the right side
| of the arrow to the variable name on the left side of the arrow.

...

  |=========                                      |  18%
| To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x <- 5 + 7. This can be
| read as 'x gets 5 plus 7'. Give it a try now.

> 
> x <- 5 + 7

| You got it right!

  |==========                                     |  21%
| You'll notice that R did not print the result of 12 this time. When you use the assignment
| operator, R assumes that you don't want to see the result immediately, but rather that you
| intend to use the result for something else later on.

...

  |===========                                    |  24%
| To view the contents of the variable x, just type x and press Enter. Try it now.

> x
[1] 12

| You are amazing!

  |============                                   |  26%
| Now, store the result of x - 3 in a new variable called y.

> y<-x-3

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |==============                                 |  29%
| What is the value of y? Type y to find out.

> y
[1] 9

| That's correct!

  |===============                                |  32%
| Now, let's create a small collection of numbers called a vector. Any object that contains
| data is called a data structure and numeric vectors are the simplest type of data structure
| in R. In fact, even a single number is considered a vector of length one.

...

  |================                               |  34%
| The easiest way to create a vector is with the c() function, which stands for 'concatenate'
| or 'combine'. To create a vector containing the numbers 1.1, 9, and 3.14, type c(1.1, 9,
| 3.14). Try it now and store the result in a variable called z.

> z<-c(1.1, 9, 3.14)

| You are really on a roll!

  |=================                              |  37%
| Anytime you have questions about a particular function, you can access R's built-in help
| files via the `?` command. For example, if you want more information on the c() function,
| type ?c without the parentheses that normally follow a function name. Give it a try.

> ?c

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |===================                            |  39%
| Type z to view its contents. Notice that there are no commas separating the values in the
| output.

> z
[1] 1.10 9.00 3.14

| You are amazing!

  |====================                           |  42%
| You can combine vectors to make a new vector. Create a new vector that contains z, 555,
| then z again in that order. Don't assign this vector to a new variable, so that we can just
| see the result immediately.

> c(z, 555, z)
[1]   1.10   9.00   3.14 555.00   1.10   9.00   3.14

| That's correct!

  |=====================                          |  45%
| Numeric vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions. Type the following to see what
| happens: z * 2 + 100.

> z*2+100
[1] 102.20 118.00 106.28

| You're the best!

  |======================                         |  47%
| First, R multiplied each of the three elements in z by 2. Then it added 100 to each element
| to get the result you see above.

...

  |========================                       |  50%
| Other common arithmetic operators are `+`, `-`, `/`, and `^` (where x^2 means 'x squared').
| To take the square root, use the sqrt() function and to take the absolute value, use the
| abs() function.

...

  |=========================                      |  53%
| Take the square root of z - 1 and assign it to a new variable called my_sqrt.

> my_sqrt<-sgrt(z-1)
Ошибка в sgrt(z - 1) : не могу найти функцию "sgrt"

> my_sqrt<-sqrt(z-1)

| That's correct!

  |==========================                     |  55%
| Before we view the contents of the my_sqrt variable, what do you think it contains?

1: a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)
2: a vector of length 0 (i.e. an empty vector)
3: a vector of length 3

Выбор: 3

| You're the best!

  |===========================                    |  58%
| Print the contents of my_sqrt.

> my_sqrt
[1] 0.3162278 2.8284271 1.4628739

| You got it right!

  |============================                   |  61%
| As you may have guessed, R first subtracted 1 from each element of z, then took the square
| root of each element. This leaves you with a vector of the same length as the original
| vector z.

...

  |==============================                 |  63%
| Now, create a new variable called my_div that gets the value of z divided by my_sqrt.

> my_div <- z/my_sqrt

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |===============================                |  66%
| Which statement do you think is true?

1: my_div is undefined
2: The first element of my_div is equal to the first element of z divided by the first element of my_sqrt, and so on...
3: my_div is a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)

Выбор: 1

| Try again. Getting it right on the first try is boring anyway!

| Think about how R handled the other 'vectorized' operations like `+` and `*`.

1: my_div is undefined
2: The first element of my_div is equal to the first element of z divided by the first element of my_sqrt, and so on...
3: my_div is a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)

Выбор: 2

| Keep up the great work!

  |================================               |  68%
| Go ahead and print the contents of my_div.

> my_div
[1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460

| Great job!

  |=================================              |  71%
| When given two vectors of the same length, R simply performs the specified arithmetic
| operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, etc.) element-by-element. If the vectors are of different
| lengths, R 'recycles' the shorter vector until it is the same length as the longer vector.

...

  |===================================            |  74%
| When we did z * 2 + 100 in our earlier example, z was a vector of length 3, but technically
| 2 and 100 are each vectors of length 1.

...

  |====================================           |  76%
| Behind the scenes, R is 'recycling' the 2 to make a vector of 2s and the 100 to make a
| vector of 100s. In other words, when you ask R to compute z * 2 + 100, what it really
| computes is this: z * c(2, 2, 2) + c(100, 100, 100).

...

  |=====================================          |  79%
| To see another example of how this vector 'recycling' works, try adding c(1, 2, 3, 4) and
| c(0, 10). Don't worry about saving the result in a new variable.

> c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10)
[1]  1 12  3 14

| Excellent work!

  |======================================         |  82%
| If the length of the shorter vector does not divide evenly into the length of the longer
| vector, R will still apply the 'recycling' method, but will throw a warning to let you know
| something fishy might be going on.

...

  |========================================       |  84%
| Try c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) for an example.

> c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100)
Warning in c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) :
  длина большего объекта не является произведением длины меньшего объекта
[1]   1  12 103   4

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |=========================================      |  87%
| Before concluding this lesson, I'd like to show you a couple of time-saving tricks.

...

  |==========================================     |  89%
| Earlier in the lesson, you computed z * 2 + 100. Let's pretend that you made a mistake and
| that you meant to add 1000 instead of 100. You could either re-type the expression, or...

...

  |===========================================    |  92%
| In many programming environments, the up arrow will cycle through previous commands. Try
| hitting the up arrow on your keyboard until you get to this command (z * 2 + 100), then
| change 100 to 1000 and hit Enter. If the up arrow doesn't work for you, just type the
| corrected command.

> z*2+1000
[1] 1002.20 1018.00 1006.28

| That's correct!

  |=============================================  |  95%
| Finally, let's pretend you'd like to view the contents of a variable that you created
| earlier, but you can't seem to remember if you named it my_div or myDiv. You could try both
| and see what works, or...

...

  |============================================== |  97%
| You can type the first two letters of the variable name, then hit the Tab key (possibly
| more than once). Most programming environments will provide a list of variables that you've
| created that begin with 'my'. This is called auto-completion and can be quite handy when
| you have many variables in your workspace. Give it a try. (If auto-completion doesn't work
| for you, just type my_div and press Enter.)

> my_div
[1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460

| All that practice is paying off!

| In this lesson, you'll learn how to examine your local workspace in R and begin to explore
| the relationship between your workspace and the file system of your machine.

...

  |==                                                                                  |   3%
| Because different operating systems have different conventions with regards to things like
| file paths, the outputs of these commands may vary across machines.

...

  |====                                                                                |   5%
| However it's important to note that R provides a common API (a common set of commands) for
| interacting with files, that way your code will work across different kinds of computers.

...

  |======                                                                              |   8%
| Let's jump right in so you can get a feel for how these special functions work!

...

  |=========                                                                           |  10%
| Determine which directory your R session is using as its current working directory using
| getwd().

> getwd()
[1] "C:/Users/borle/Documents/TH25"

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |===========                                                                         |  13%
| List all the objects in your local workspace using ls().

> ls()
[1] "my_div"  "my_sqrt" "x"       "y"       "z"      

| That's correct!

  |=============                                                                       |  15%
| Some R commands are the same as their equivalents commands on Linux or on a Mac. Both Linux
| and Mac operating systems are based on an operating system called Unix. It's always a good
| idea to learn more about Unix!

...

  |===============                                                                     |  18%
| Assign 9 to x using x <- 9.

> x <- 9

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

| Now take a look at objects that are in your workspace using ls().

> ls()
[1] "my_div"  "my_sqrt" "x"       "y"       "z"      

| You are amazing!

  |===================                                                                 |  23%
| List all the files in your working directory using list.files() or dir().

> dir()
[1] "L1"         "README.md"  "TH25.Rproj"

| Excellent work!

  |======================                                                              |  26%
| As we go through this lesson, you should be examining the help page for each new function.
| Check out the help page for list.files with the command ?list.files.

> ?
+ list.files()

| That's not exactly what I'm looking for. Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Type ?list.files to see the help page.

> ?list.files

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |========================                                                            |  28%
| One of the most helpful parts of any R help file is the See Also section. Read that section
| for list.files. Some of these functions may be used in later portions of this lesson.

...

  |==========================                                                          |  31%
| Using the args() function on a function name is also a handy way to see what arguments a
| function can take.

...

  |============================                                                        |  33%
| Use the args() function to determine the arguments to list.files().

> args(list.files)
function (path = ".", pattern = NULL, all.files = FALSE, full.names = FALSE, 
    recursive = FALSE, ignore.case = FALSE, include.dirs = FALSE, 
    no.. = FALSE) 
NULL

| You got it!

| Assign the value of the current working directory to a variable called "old.dir".

> old.dir<-getwd()

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |================================                                                    |  38%
| We will use old.dir at the end of this lesson to move back to the place that we started. A
| lot of query functions like getwd() have the useful property that they return the answer to
| the question as a result of the function.

...

  |==================================                                                  |  41%
| Use dir.create() to create a directory in the current working directory called "testdir".

> dir.create("testdir")

| You are quite good my friend!

  |=====================================                                               |  44%
| We will do all our work in this new directory and then delete it after we are done. This is

| In this lesson, you'll learn how to create sequences of numbers in R.

...

  |====                                                                                |   4%
| The simplest way to create a sequence of numbers in R is by using the `:` operator. Type
| 1:20 to see how it works.

> 1:20
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

| That's correct!

  |=======                                                                             |   9%
| That gave us every integer between (and including) 1 and 20. We could also use it to create
| a sequence of real numbers. For example, try pi:10.

> pi:10
[1] 3.141593 4.141593 5.141593 6.141593 7.141593 8.141593 9.141593

| That's correct!

  |===========                                                                         |  13%
| The result is a vector of real numbers starting with pi (3.142...) and increasing in
| increments of 1. The upper limit of 10 is never reached, since the next number in our
| sequence would be greater than 10.

...

  |===============                                                                     |  17%
| What happens if we do 15:1? Give it a try to find out.

| All that hard work is paying off!

| It counted backwards in increments of 1! It's unlikely we'd want this behavior, but
| nonetheless it's good to know how it could happen.

| Remember that if you have questions about a particular R function, you can access its
| documentation with a question mark followed by the function name: ?function_name_here.
| However, in the case of an operator like the colon used above, you must enclose the symbol
| in backticks like this: ?`:`. (NOTE: The backtick (`) key is generally located in the top
| left corner of a keyboard, above the Tab key. If you don't have a backtick key, you can use
| regular quotes.)

...

  |==========================                                                          |  30%
| Pull up the documentation for `:` now.

> ?:
Ошибка: неожиданный ':' в "?:"

> ?':'

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |=============================                                                       |  35%
| Often, we'll desire more control over a sequence we're creating than what the `:` operator
| gives us. The seq() function serves this purpose.

...

  |=================================                                                   |  39%
| The most basic use of seq() does exactly the same thing as the `:` operator. Try seq(1, 20)
| to see this.

> seq(1, 20)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

| That's correct!

  |=====================================                                               |  43%
| This gives us the same output as 1:20. However, let's say that instead we want a vector of
| numbers ranging from 0 to 10, incremented by 0.5. seq(0, 10, by=0.5) does just that. Try it
| out.

> seq(0, 10, by=0.5)
 [1]  0.0  0.5  1.0  1.5  2.0  2.5  3.0  3.5  4.0  4.5  5.0  5.5  6.0  6.5  7.0  7.5  8.0  8.5
[19]  9.0  9.5 10.0

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |========================================                                            |  48%
| Or maybe we don't care what the increment is and we just want a sequence of 30 numbers
| between 5 and 10. seq(5, 10, length=30) does the trick. Give it a shot now and store the
| result in a new variable called my_seq.

> my_seq <- seq(5, 10, length=30)

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |============================================                                        |  52%
| To confirm that my_seq has length 30, we can use the length() function. Try it now.

> lenght(my_seq)
Ошибка в lenght(my_seq) : не могу найти функцию "lenght"

> length(my_seq)
[1] 30

| Keep up the great work!

  |===============================================                                     |  57%
| Let's pretend we don't know the length of my_seq, but we want to generate a sequence of
| integers from 1 to N, where N represents the length of the my_seq vector. In other words,
| we want a new vector (1, 2, 3, ...) that is the same length as my_seq.

...

  |===================================================                                 |  61%
| There are several ways we could do this. One possibility is to combine the `:` operator and
| the length() function like this: 1:length(my_seq). Give that a try.

> 1:length(my_seq)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30

| You got it!

  |=======================================================                             |  65%
| Another option is to use seq(along.with = my_seq). Give that a try.

> seq(along.with = my_seq)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |==========================================================                          |  70%
| However, as is the case with many common tasks, R has a separate built-in function for this
| purpose called seq_along(). Type seq_along(my_seq) to see it in action.

> seq_along(my_seq)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30

| You're the best!

  |==============================================================                      |  74%
| There are often several approaches to solving the same problem, particularly in R. Simple
| approaches that involve less typing are generally best. It's also important for your code
| to be readable, so that you and others can figure out what's going on without too much
| hassle.

...

  |==================================================================                  |  78%
| If R has a built-in function for a particular task, it's likely that function is highly
| optimized for that purpose and is your best option. As you become a more advanced R
| programmer, you'll design your own functions to perform tasks when there are no better
| options. We'll explore writing your own functions in future lessons.

...

  |=====================================================================               |  83%
| One more function related to creating sequences of numbers is rep(), which stands for
| 'replicate'. Let's look at a few uses.

...

  |=========================================================================           |  87%
| If we're interested in creating a vector that contains 40 zeros, we can use rep(0, times =
| 40). Try it out.

> rep(0, times=40)
 [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

| You are doing so well!

  |=============================================================================       |  91%
| If instead we want our vector to contain 10 repetitions of the vector (0, 1, 2), we can do
| rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10). Go ahead.

> rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10)
 [1] 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2

| All that practice is paying off!

  |================================================================================    |  96%
| Finally, let's say that rather than repeating the vector (0, 1, 2) over and over again, we
| want our vector to contain 10 zeros, then 10 ones, then 10 twos. We can do this with the
| `each` argument. Try rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10).

> rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10)
 [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

| Vectors come in two different flavors: atomic vectors and lists. An atomic vector contains
| exactly one data type, whereas a list may contain multiple data types. We'll explore atomic
| vectors further before we get to lists.

...

  |====                                                                                |   5%
| In previous lessons, we dealt entirely with numeric vectors, which are one type of atomic
| vector. Other types of atomic vectors include logical, character, integer, and complex. In
| this lesson, we'll take a closer look at logical and character vectors.

...

  |=======                                                                             |   8%
| Logical vectors can contain the values TRUE, FALSE, and NA (for 'not available'). These

| Now, create a variable called tf that gets the result of num_vect < 1, which is read as
| 'num_vect is less than 1'.

> tf <- num_vect-1

| That's not exactly what I'm looking for. Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

  |===============                                                                     |  18%
| Print the contents of tf now.

> tf
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE

| You are quite good my friend!

  |==================                                                                  |  21%
| The statement num_vect < 1 is a condition and tf tells us whether each corresponding
| element of our numeric vector num_vect satisfies this condition.

...

  |====================                                                                |  24%
| The first element of num_vect is 0.5, which is less than 1 and therefore the statement 0.5
| < 1 is TRUE. The second element of num_vect is 55, which is greater than 1, so the
| statement 55 < 1 is FALSE. The same logic applies for the third and fourth elements.

...

  |======================                                                              |  26%
| Let's try another. Type num_vect >= 6 without assigning the result to a new variable.

> num_vect >= 6
[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE

| You are doing so well!

  |========================                                                            |  29%
| This time, we are asking whether each individual element of num_vect is greater than OR
| equal to 6. Since only 55 and 6 are greater than or equal to 6, the second and fourth
| elements of the result are TRUE and the first and third elements are FALSE.

...

  |===========================                                                         |  32%
| The `<` and `>=` symbols in these examples are called 'logical operators'. Other logical
| operators include `>`, `<=`, `==` for exact equality, and `!=` for inequality.

...

  |=============================                                                       |  34%
| If we have two logical expressions, A and B, we can ask whether at least one is TRUE with A
| | B (logical 'or' a.k.a. 'union') or whether they are both TRUE with A & B (logical 'and'
| a.k.a. 'intersection'). Lastly, !A is the negation of A and is TRUE when A is FALSE and
| vice versa.

...

  |===============================                                                     |  37%
| It's a good idea to spend some time playing around with various combinations of these
| logical operators until you get comfortable with their use. We'll do a few examples here to
| get you started.

| Try your best to predict the result of each of the following statements. You can use pencil

| Don't worry if you found these to be tricky. They're supposed to be. Working with logical
| statements in R takes practice, but your efforts will be rewarded in future lessons (e.g.
| subsetting and control structures).

...

  |============================================                                        |  53%
| Character vectors are also very common in R. Double quotes are used to distinguish
| character objects, as in the following example.

...

  |==============================================                                      |  55%
| Create a character vector that contains the following words: "My", "name", "is". Remember
| to enclose each word in its own set of double quotes, so that R knows they are character
| strings. Store the vector in a variable called my_char.

> my_char <- c("My", "name", "is")

| Keep up the great work!

  |=================================================                                   |  58%
| Print the contents of my_char to see what it looks like.

> my_char
[1] "My"   "name" "is"  

| All that practice is paying off!

  |===================================================                                 |  61%
| Right now, my_char is a character vector of length 3. Let's say we want to join the
| elements of my_char together into one continuous character string (i.e. a character vector
| of length 1). We can do this using the paste() function.

...

  |=====================================================                               |  63%
| Type paste(my_char, collapse = " ") now. Make sure there's a space between the double
| quotes in the `collapse` argument. You'll see why in a second.

> paste(my_char, collapse = " ")
[1] "My name is"

| Great job!

  |=======================================================                             |  66%
| The `collapse` argument to the paste() function tells R that when we join together the
| elements of the my_char character vector, we'd like to separate them with single spaces.

...

  |=========================================================                           |  68%
| It seems that we're missing something.... Ah, yes! Your name!

...

  |============================================================                        |  71%
| To add (or 'concatenate') your name to the end of my_char, use the c() function like this:
| c(my_char, "your_name_here"). Place your name in double quotes where I've put
| "your_name_here". Try it now, storing the result in a new variable called my_name.

> my_name <- c(my_char, "boresom")

| All that practice is paying off!

  |==============================================================                      |  74%
| Take a look at the contents of my_name.

> my_name
[1] "My"      "name"    "is"      "boresom"

| Great job!

  |================================================================                    |  76%
| Now, use the paste() function once more to join the words in my_name together into a single
| character string. Don't forget to say collapse = " "!

> paste(my_name, collapse=" ")
[1] "My name is boresom"

| You got it!

  |==================================================================                  |  79%
| In this example, we used the paste() function to collapse the elements of a single
| character vector. paste() can also be used to join the elements of multiple character
| vectors.

...

  |=====================================================================               |  82%
| In the simplest case, we can join two character vectors that are each of length 1 (i.e.
| join two words). Try paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " "), where the `sep` argument tells R
| that we want to separate the joined elements with a single space.

> paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " ")
[1] "Hello world!"

| You are really on a roll!

  |=======================================================================             |  84%
| For a slightly more complicated example, we can join two vectors, each of length 3. Use
| paste() to join the integer vector 1:3 with the character vector c("X", "Y", "Z"). This
| time, use sep = "" to leave no space between the joined elements.

> paste(1:3, c("X", "Y", "Z"), sep="")
[1] "1X" "2Y" "3Z"

| You got it right!

  |=========================================================================           |  87%
| What do you think will happen if our vectors are of different length? (Hint: we talked
| about this in a previous lesson.)

...

  |===========================================================================         |  89%
| Vector recycling! Try paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-"), where LETTERS is a predefined
| variable in R containing a character vector of all 26 letters in the English alphabet.

> paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-")
 [1] "A-1" "B-2" "C-3" "D-4" "E-1" "F-2" "G-3" "H-4" "I-1" "J-2" "K-3" "L-4" "M-1" "N-2" "O-3"
[16] "P-4" "Q-1" "R-2" "S-3" "T-4" "U-1" "V-2" "W-3" "X-4" "Y-1" "Z-2"

| Nice work!

  |=============================================================================       |  92%
| Since the character vector LETTERS is longer than the numeric vector 1:4, R simply
| recycles, or repeats, 1:4 until it matches the length of LETTERS.

...

  |================================================================================    |  95%
| Also worth noting is that the numeric vector 1:4 gets 'coerced' into a character vector by
| the paste() function.

...

  |==================================================================================  |  97%
| We'll discuss coercion in another lesson, but all it really means is that the numbers 1, 2,
| 3, and 4 in the output above are no longer numbers to R, but rather characters "1", "2",
| "3", and "4".

| Missing values play an important role in statistics and data analysis. Often, missing
| values must not be ignored, but rather they should be carefully studied to see if there's
| an underlying pattern or cause for their missingness.

...

  |====                                                                                |   5%
| In R, NA is used to represent any value that is 'not available' or 'missing' (in the
| statistical sense). In this lesson, we'll explore missing values further.

...

  |========                                                                            |  10%
| Any operation involving NA generally yields NA as the result. To illustrate, let's create a
| vector c(44, NA, 5, NA) and assign it to a variable x.

> x <- c(44, NA, 5, NA)

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |=============                                                                       |  15%
| Now, let's multiply x by 3.

> x*3
[1] 132  NA  15  NA

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |=================                                                                   |  20%
| Notice that the elements of the resulting vector that correspond with the NA values in x
| are also NA.

...

  |=====================                                                               |  25%
| To make things a little more interesting, lets create a vector containing 1000 draws from a
| standard normal distribution with y <- rnorm(1000).

> y <- rnorm(1000)

| All that practice is paying off!

  |=========================                                                           |  30%
| Next, let's create a vector containing 1000 NAs with z <- rep(NA, 1000).

> z <- rep(NA, 1000)

| That's correct!

  |=============================                                                       |  35%
| Finally, let's select 100 elements at random from these 2000 values (combining y and z)
| such that we don't know how many NAs we'll wind up with or what positions they'll occupy in
| our final vector -- my_data <- sample(c(y, z), 100).

> my_data <- sample(c(y, z), 100)

| Great job!

  |==================================                                                  |  40%
| Let's first ask the question of where our NAs are located in our data. The is.na() function
| tells us whether each element of a vector is NA. Call is.na() on my_data and assign the
| result to my_na.

> my_na <- is.na(my_data)

| You got it!

  |======================================                                              |  45%
| Now, print my_na to see what you came up with.

> my_na
  [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
 [15] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
 [29] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
 [43]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
 [57] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
 [71] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
 [85] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
 [99] FALSE FALSE

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |==========================================                                          |  50%
| Everywhere you see a TRUE, you know the corresponding element of my_data is NA. Likewise,
| everywhere you see a FALSE, you know the corresponding element of my_data is one of our
| random draws from the standard normal distribution.

...

  |==============================================                                      |  55%
| In our previous discussion of logical operators, we introduced the `==` operator as a
| method of testing for equality between two objects. So, you might think the expression
| my_data == NA yields the same results as is.na(). Give it a try.

> my_data == NA
  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
 [30] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
 [59] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
 [88] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

| You are quite good my friend!

  |==================================================                                  |  60%
| The reason you got a vector of all NAs is that NA is not really a value, but just a
| placeholder for a quantity that is not available. Therefore the logical expression is
| incomplete and R has no choice but to return a vector of the same length as my_data that
| contains all NAs.

...

  |=======================================================                             |  65%
| Don't worry if that's a little confusing. The key takeaway is to be cautious when using
| logical expressions anytime NAs might creep in, since a single NA value can derail the
| entire thing.

...

  |===========================================================                         |  70%
| So, back to the task at hand. Now that we have a vector, my_na, that has a TRUE for every
| NA and FALSE for every numeric value, we can compute the total number of NAs in our data.

...

  |===============================================================                     |  75%
| The trick is to recognize that underneath the surface, R represents TRUE as the number 1
| and FALSE as the number 0. Therefore, if we take the sum of a bunch of TRUEs and FALSEs, we
| get the total number of TRUEs.

...

  |===================================================================                 |  80%
| Let's give that a try here. Call the sum() function on my_na to count the total number of
| TRUEs in my_na, and thus the total number of NAs in my_data. Don't assign the result to a
| new variable.

> sum(my_na)
[1] 53

| That's a job well done!

  |=======================================================================             |  85%
| Pretty cool, huh? Finally, let's take a look at the data to convince ourselves that
| everything 'adds up'. Print my_data to the console.
